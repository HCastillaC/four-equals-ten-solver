# four-equals-ten-solver
 A program to solve the mobile game 4 = 10.

 It is recommended to use this code as a last resource option, as the game is more fun if you try to solve by yourself.

## How to use
 To use it, just input the four number given in your level, one by one, and the program will do the rest of the rest of the work.

 It works using a text-based interface, so don't expect any graphics - sorry, I gotta learn how to do them.
